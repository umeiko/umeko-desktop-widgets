# Umeko Desktop Widgets

A collection of interesting and practical Widgets for [Umeko Desktop](https://github.com/umeiko/umeko-desktop). This repository is intended to make small desktop extensions easy to discover, install, and understand.

## Available Widgets

| Widget | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [Billion Context](widgets/billion-context) | Status and setup for [`billion-context`](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context), a third-party context-compression plugin that keeps month-long sessions within a small context window and uses fewer tokens. Checks the global installation and local proxy health, provides installation guidance, and opens the author's dashboard. |

## Install a Widget

1. Download the Widget ZIP from the GitHub Release for this repository.
2. In Umeko Desktop, open **Settings → Agent → Plugin Management** and import the ZIP.
3. Enable the Widget explicitly and open its page from the chat Widget menu.

The installable ZIP is attached to a GitHub Release and is not tracked as an artifact in this repository.

## Billion Context requirements

The Billion Context Widget requires a separate global installation of [`billion-context`](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context):

```sh
npm install -g billion-context
```

The Widget is **disabled by default**. It does not install the package, start the proxy, change Pi settings, or implement context compression itself. It only reports installation and proxy status and provides links to the author's project and local dashboard.

See the [Widget README](widgets/billion-context/README.md) for behavior and status meanings, and the [billion-context license](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context/blob/master/LICENSE) for the upstream attribution requirements.
